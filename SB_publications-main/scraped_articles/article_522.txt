GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT The Fusarium oxysporum species complex represents one of the most important plant pathogens worldwide, causing disease in many economically important plants and crops ( 1 ), but can also cause opportunistic infections in humans ( 2 , 3 ). However, F. oxysporum , like other fungi, produces many bioactive compounds that are beneficial to humans ( 4 , 5 ) and could be exploited for use in the pharmaceutical/medical industries. During the course of the Veggie project (a vegetable production system flown onboard the International Space Station [ISS] to study the effects of the space environment on plant growth and function), Zinnia hybrida plants became afflicted with a foliar, stem, and root rot disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum . Isolates were cultured from the leaf (VEG-01C1) and the root (VEG-01C2) of these infected plants, and the draft whole-genome sequences are described herein. The whole-genome sequences were paired-end sequenced (2 100 bp) on the Illumina HiSeq platform with a 350-bp insert size. A total of 33 million reads (GC content, 47.5 ) and 46 million reads (GC content, 46.8 ) were obtained from VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2, respectively. Trimmomatic, on the Galaxy server ( https://usegalaxy.org ), was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings, max mismatch, 2; how accurate the match between the two adaptor ligated reads, 30; how accurate the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings, minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled with ABySS version 2.0.2 ( 6 ) using k -mer sizes of 80 (VEG-01C1) and 88 (VEG-01C2). The VEG-01C1 assembly resulted in a genome size of 49.3 Mb, with an N 50 value of 376,797 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,455, with a max scaffold length of 1,817,733 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 588. The VEG-01C2 assembly resulted in a genome size of 48.9 Mb, with an N 50 of 334,342 bp. The number of scaffolds generated was 6,398, with a max scaffold length of 2,326,957 bp. The number of scaffolds over 1 kb was 637. The assembled genomes were compared to those of 66 F. oxysporum isolates downloaded from NCBI ( ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/genbank/fungi/Fusarium_oxysporum/ ), as well as those of two isolates cultured from ISS environmental surfaces, using (i) 10 phylogenetically informative loci ( 7 ) and (ii) the presence/absence of effector proteins ( 8 ). Both methods showed that VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2 were most closely related to F. oxysporum IMV-00293, an isolate cultured in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_001931975). To note, this isolate was incorrectly identified and deposited as Fusarium solani ( 9 ). Interestingly, F. oxysporum strains VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and IMV-00293 (i.e., the Chernobyl strain) were very similar to the clinical F. oxysporum strain FOSC 3-a (GenBank assembly accession number GCA_000271745), an isolate cultured from blood from a patient in the United States suffering from fusariosis. Comparative genomics of these Z. hybrida leaf and root fungal strains with the Chernobyl (IMV-00293) strain could provide insight into which genes could allow for growth in extreme environments, such as those involved in radiation resistance. Accession number(s). The assembled whole-genome sequences have been deposited in DDBL/EMBL/GenBank under the accession numbers PXUO00000000 (VEG-01C1) and PXUN00000000 (VEG-01C2). The strains have also been deposited in NASA s GeneLab; https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-177/ . These are the first versions.
