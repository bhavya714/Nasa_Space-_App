PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC10793275 PMID: 38038463 ABSTRACT Sphingomonadaceae are common membrane colonizers and biofilm formers. As part of our studies on long-term genetic changes in drinking water biofilm species, we report the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. The isolate was determined as Sphingomonas paucimobilis through whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly. KEYWORDS: draft genome, WGS, water, Sphingomonas ANNOUNCEMENT Widely used for drinking water, membrane filtration systems face biofouling due to microbe accumulation and biofilm formation. Studies reveal Sphingomonadaceae as common initial colonizers, persisting dominantly during biofilm growth ( 1 4 ). Here, we report the genome sequence of a prevalent isolate. Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 was isolated from a biofilm on a Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane used for drinking water biofouling studies ( 1 , 5 ). Sph5 was previously reported to be phylogenetically closest to Sphingomonas sanguinis strains BAB-7166 (99 ) and NBRC 13937 (99 ) based on 16S rRNA sequencing and cultivation methods ( 1 ). However, the whole genome sequence (WGS) was not reported. WGS analysis is critical to uncover strain-specific traits associated with membrane biofouling. Here, we report the WGS of Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 using Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo assembly methods. We received the Sphingomonas spp. Sph5 water isolate from Wetsus, Netherlands. Single isolated colonies were obtained on Reasoner s 2A agar (R2A, Teknova R0005; Difco 214530) and cultured in R2A broth at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy UltraClean microbial kit (Qiagen 12224) following the company-provided protocol. Sequencing libraries were generated using Kapa s Hyperplus kit (KK8514) and IDT adapters ( 00989130v2). Quality was verified using an Agilent Tapestation and qPCR (NEBNext Library Quant Kit, E7630L) on Thermo Fisher s Quantstudio5. Nineteen million 2 150 bp reads were obtained on a NovaSeq (Illumina) at Anschutz Medical Campus Genomics and Microarray Core, with an average Phred score of 33 36 calculated by FastQC [v0.11.9 ( 6 )]. Assembly was performed with SPADES, default isolate settings [v3.15.2 ( 7 )]. Contigs were aligned to NCBI databases with DIAMOND [v2.0.13 ( 8 )]. Completeness was estimated using BUSCO [v5.2.2 ( 9 )] proteobacteria marker genes. Of the 219 genes, there were 214 (97.7 ) complete and single copy, 2 (0.9 ) duplicated, 1 (0.5 ) fragmented, and 2 (0.9 ) missing. For species identification, average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated between all complete Sphingomonas genomes and Sph5 with PYANI [v0.2.11 ( 10 )] and MUMMER [v4.0.0 ( 11 )]. ANI scores between Sph5 and S. paucimobilis ranged from 99.77 99.95 , while ANI between Sph5 and S. sanguinis was 87.74 . Annotations were predicted with Prokka [v1.14.6 ( 12 )], given S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis references ( Table 1 ), and used for orthogroup-based phylogeny construction with Orthofinder [v2.5.4 ( 13 )], MAFFT [v7.490 ( 14 )], and FastTree [v.2.1.10 ( 15 )].

JAMRJL000000000 Country The Netherlands Source Biofilm on Nadir MP005 microfiltration membrane Feed water source Tap water from the city of Leeuwarden Genome size (bp) 4680620 N 50 (bp) 4016723 Scaffold reference ASM1602843v1 Scaffolds 50,000 bp 29, 4 Mean coverage 1,089 G C content ( ) 65.30 No. of annotated CDS 3,342 No. of raw reads 19,032,602 No. of reads used for assembly 19,032,602 No. of coding sequences 4,321 Open in a new tab The WGS phylogeny ( Fig. 1 ) confirms that Sph5 is closest to S. paucimobilis while related to S. sanguinis . As a result, S. paucimobilis reference genomes were used for RagTag [v2.1.0 ( 16 )] scaffolding of Sph5 contigs. ASM1602843v1 was the best scaffold (93.6 total length in three longest contigs of resulting assembly). Realignment of raw reads to ASM1602843v1-scaffolded Sph5 assembly with BWA [v0.7.17 ( 17 )], SamTools [v1.12 ( 18 )], and Picard [v2.25.0 ( 19 )], evaluated by Mosdepth [v0.3.3 ( 20 )], supports this (99.48 reads aligned, 1,089 coverage). Fig 1. Open in a new tab Orthofinder-generated rooted tree of 50 complete Sphingomonas genomes with the Sph5 strain. Branch lengths represent evolutionary distance. We used the multiple-sequence alignment option with MAFFT and used FastTree to infer the trees. The mathematical parameters used are built in to the OrthoFinder tool, and we did not alter them from the default. Re-annotation with Prokka predicts 4,321 CDS, 3 rRNAs, 54 tRNAs, 1 tmRNA, and 1 repeat region. Of the CDS, 3,342 could be functionally annotated.
